Changing the style of the variable <div style={{ backgroundColor:'red'}}></div

in JSx element we use className instead of class because to avoid javascript collison

jsx can easily reference javascript variables in {}=> reference variable

javascript objects can be referenced in the jsx unless we don't use it for printing


Component Nesting:-
  In react application we usually make many different components when we make many different

components. We then nest them or essentially place them in each other to make an actual usable re-act application.

Component Reuseability:-
We strive to make reusable components or little pieces of code that can be reused several different times inside our app
